  **************    ASSIGNMENT 7 REPORT     *****************
***************************************************************

In this assignment we implemented 7 functions create, open, close, mount, read, write and seek
by implementing a file system in xinu. We learnt how to manage initalize the file system and 
create a directory structure. We implemented the File Table and maintained a list of open files
in the table. We created the inode structure and added them on to open files and also wrote them
to disk. Once open, we implement write and read functions to write/read the data to/from data blocks 
and assign them to the inode structure. The seek function will set the offset in the file table 
from which the read and write functions will modify/read the file.

Following is the lifecycle of a file:
Create -> Open(implicit) -> Write -> Seek -> Read -> Close

We have implemented and tested the code for the following scenarios:
1. Create single file.
2. Create multiple files. (/// -> 3 comment lines in xsh_fstest.c)
3. Close and reopen an existing file. (//// -> 4 comment lines in xsh_fstest.c)

Task Distribution:-
Srikanth  -> Implemented read, write and seek functions and integrating the functions.
Mangirish -> Implemented create, open, mount and close functions.
